Problem: The Dropdowns in the nav on mobile screen were not dropping down.
Cause: I got the dropdown template from an older version of bootstrap where the field was data-toggle.
Solution: Changed the data field name to data-bs-toggle.

Problem: The bootstrap collapse function was opening when clicked.
Cause: The template I used was from an older version of bootstrap where the field was data-target.
Solution: Changed the data field name to data-bs-target.

Problem: The sale banner is below the toggle sidebar option on the list products page.
Cause: The toggle sidebar button is written above the banner.
Solution: 

Problem: When the product page loads, the arrow on the accordion is pointing up when it should be pointing down.
Cause: The correct class is not written to the element.
Solution: Append the collapsed class to each accordion button.

Problem: The nav bar has disappeared from the home page.
Cause: I added the d-lg-none class to the row that contains the nav bar as it isn't necessary on the main page.
Solution: Used JS to remove the class when the index page loads, and then to add the class again once the page unloads.
