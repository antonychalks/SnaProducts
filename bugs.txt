Problem: The Dropdowns in the nav on mobile screen were not dropping down.
Cause: I got the dropdown template from an older version of bootstrap where the field was data-toggle.
Solution: Changed the data field name to data-bs-toggle.

Problem: The bootstrap collapse function was opening when clicked.
Cause: The template I used was from an older version of bootstrap where the field was data-target.
Solution: Changed the data field name to data-bs-target.

Problem: The sale banner is below the toggle sidebar option on the list products page.
Cause: The toggle sidebar button is written above the banner.
Solution: 

Problem: When the product page loads, the arrow on the accordion is pointing up when it should be pointing down.
Cause: The correct class is not written to the element.
Solution: Append the collapsed class to each accordion button.

Problem: The nav bar has disappeared from the home page.
Cause: I added the d-lg-none class to the row that contains the nav bar as it isn't necessary on the main page.
Solution: Used JS to remove the class when the index page loads, and then to add the class again once the page unloads.

Problem: There are two burger icons on the mobile version on the product list page which do nothing.
Cause: One burger icon was in place on the home screen for the departments, but isn't necessary on the products list page. The other burger icon was still in place from legacy code.
Solution: Set JS to hide the burger icon when on the list products page.

Problem: When you click on the parent catergory, nothing is displayed.
Cause: The product is only shown when the child category is clicked, the parent catergory isn't associated with the product.
Solution: 

Problem: When the sorting in descening, the current option isn't selected in the box.
Cause: The if statements within the options doesn't include [option]_desc, only [option]_asc
Solution: Added an or option to each if statement to include desc.

Problem: The sidebar was squashed into the middle of the screen, rather than displaying on the left.
Cause: I added an ID of nav-sidebar to the parent div on the row level, which had CSS written for it telling the div to transformX: 50%.
Solution: Moved the ID to be for the toggle button, apposed to the whole div.
