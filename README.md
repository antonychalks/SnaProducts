## Future Development

#### Allowing users to rate products
In the future I would like to create a rating system that allows users that have bought a product to leave a rating. This allows customers to see what products will suit their needs, as well as informing the store management where to focus their investments.


#### Payment system
I want to implement PayPal payment system in the future as many customers prefer to use it.

#### Featured Products

I will be implementing a featured products feature, which will display on various pages, showing users a range of products available on different parts of the site. 


#### Deals and discounts

I would like to implement deals and discounts in the future which will allow store admins to apply discounts to products of their choosing, as well as deals when buying sets of products.
