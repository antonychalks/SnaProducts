## SEO
### 1 - Brainstorming general topics:
The first step in the process of search engine optimisation is to compile a list of general topics related to SnA Products store. I started by listing the four main categories of products that are available on this website. After that I added homeware as this is the type of product that SnA Products sell. 

* Kitchen

* Bedroom

* Living room

* Bathroom

* Homeware

### 2 - Brainstorming keywords for general topics:
The second step in the process is to brainstorm some short-tail key words for each general topic. For each main category I thought of the main things people might search for when browsing for products for that room.

### 3- Googling key words
I then googled the key words to find some long-tail keywords. This helps to optimise the site for search engines as it gives more opportunities for users to find the site after more specific search queries. Once I googled the key words I picked out some relevent "related searches" and "people also ask" results, as well as looking at the auto complete drop down when typing in my search query.

### 5- HTMl
Now I have the key words, I worked my way through all the templates within the site, ensuring that I use these keywords wherever I can, predominantly in headers, strong tags and links but making sure not to just stuff them in.
I made sure to set external links to pages that don't describe the page with the attribute rel="noopener". As well as adding external links that are related to this page, for example oven installation requirements on the oven page. I then ensured the images have an alt attribute with the keys words in, whilst also ensuring to describe the image. Lastly I used the keywords meta tag to implement all the key words.

When implementing these changes for SEO, I made sure to keep in mind that the content still needs to be as best as it can be. This is done by ensuring the content is useful, well informed and trust worthy. Not only does this improve the sites score for search engines, it also improved the UX of the site, which is the main priority for the site. This in turn helps to increase site traffic, which will improve the sites score.

### 6- sitemap.xml
I used an [online generator](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/) to create a sitemap for the search engines to use. 

### 7- Robots.txt
I used an [online_generator](www.seoptimer.com) to create [robots.txt](documentation/robots.txt). Robots.txt is used to tell search engines where not to look on the site, as these places aren't good at describing the site and what it's for. Having this file also boosts the search engines score on the site, as it marks the site as high quality.

### 8- DNS Certificate
In the future with a larger budget, a custom domain name would be purchased, which would provide a DNS Certificate and allow the sitemap to be registered.
